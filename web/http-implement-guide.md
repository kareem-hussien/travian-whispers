# Implementation Guide: Avoiding charset_normalizer Dependency (continued)

## Benefits of this Approach (continued)

- Uses standard library modules for HTTP requests and JSON serialization
- Provides a more robust solution for handling MongoDB ObjectId and datetime serialization
- Simplifies the codebase by using consistent JSON handling throughout

## Potential Issues to Watch For

### 1. SSL Certificate Verification

The `http_utils.py` module includes an option to disable SSL certificate verification (`verify_ssl=False`). Use this option cautiously, as it can create security vulnerabilities in production environments.

### 2. Character Encoding

Since we're explicitly handling character encoding rather than relying on `charset_normalizer`, you might encounter issues with certain international characters. If this happens, you may need to adjust the encoding parameters in `http_utils.py`.

### 3. HTTP Request Features

The standard library `urllib` module doesn't provide all the features of the `requests` library. If you were using advanced features like sessions, cookies, or automatic redirects, you might need to implement those manually.

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Consider Using aiohttp

If you need more advanced HTTP client features without the `charset_normalizer` dependency, consider using `aiohttp`:

```bash
pip install aiohttp
```

### 2. Update Dependencies Regularly

Regularly update your Python packages to get the latest bug fixes and security patches:

```bash
pip install --upgrade -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Virtual Environment Management

Consider using `pipenv` or `poetry` for better dependency management and isolation:

```bash
pip install pipenv
pipenv install -r requirements.txt
```

## Conclusion

By implementing these changes, you should be able to avoid the `charset_normalizer` dependency while maintaining all the functionality of your application. The custom HTTP utilities and JSON serialization will provide a more robust solution that doesn't depend on potentially problematic packages.

If you encounter any issues after implementation, you might need to review specific error messages and make targeted adjustments to the code.
