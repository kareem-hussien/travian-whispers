To log into your Docker container, you don't need to use a Python virtual environment. Docker containers are isolated environments, so you would use the `docker exec` command to connect to a running container. Since you're working with a Python-based application, here's how to proceed:

```bash
# Connect to the web container's shell
docker exec -it travian-whispers_web_1 bash

# Or if you specifically need a Python shell
docker exec -it travian-whispers_web_1 python3
```

If your container doesn't have bash, you can try:
```bash
docker exec -it travian-whispers_web_1 sh
```

The Python virtual environment (venv) you mentioned is typically used for development on your local machine. Inside the Docker container, the Python environment should already be set up with all dependencies installed as specified in your Dockerfile.

Creating a new virtual environment inside the container would be redundant and could potentially cause conflicts with the container's existing Python setup.

--------------------------------------------------

To view logs while working on your Docker-based project, you have several options:

### View logs for a specific container:
```bash
docker logs travian-whispers_web_1
```

### Follow the logs in real-time (keeps streaming new log entries):
```bash
docker logs -f travian-whispers_web_1
```

### View logs with timestamps:
```bash
docker logs --timestamps travian-whispers_web_1
```

### View logs from all services in your docker-compose:
```bash
docker-compose logs
```

### Follow logs from specific services:
```bash
docker-compose logs -f web mongo-express
```

### Limit log output (last 100 lines):
```bash
docker logs --tail 100 travian-whispers_web_1
```

### Save logs to a file:
```bash
docker logs travian-whispers_web_1 > web_container_logs.txt
```

These commands allow you to monitor your application's behavior in real-time, which is especially helpful during development and debugging.
