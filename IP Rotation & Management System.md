I'm implementing the IP Rotation and Management System for Travian Whispers. I'm currently working on GitHub Issue #[NUMBER]: [TITLE]

Here's background on the project:
- Travian Whispers is an automation suite for the Travian browser game
- The system uses Python, Flask, MongoDB, and Selenium for automation
- We need to prevent multiple users from sharing the same IP address
- This violates Travian's rules and can get accounts banned

For this specific issue (#[NUMBER]), I need to implement:

Here's a step-by-step solution without implementing code:
# 1. IP Pool Management System
GitHub Issue #1: Implement IP Pool Management System

Create a new database model for managing IP addresses
Develop logic to track IP usage and status
Implement functionality to add, remove, and validate IPs
Add monitoring for IP health and ban detection

## 2. Proxy Integration
GitHub Issue #2: Integrate Proxy Services

Research and integrate with reliable proxy providers (residential proxies preferred)
Create a proxy connection manager class
Implement proxy rotation based on usage patterns
Add proxy performance metrics and failure handling

### 3. User Session Isolation
GitHub Issue #3: Develop User Session Isolation System

Modify the browser automation system to use dedicated IPs per user
Implement session tracking to prevent IP conflicts
Create a scheduling system to distribute user activity across IPs
Add user-IP association logging

#### 4. Task Queuing System
GitHub Issue #4: Create Advanced Task Queuing System

Develop a priority-based task queue for user actions
Implement staggered execution to prevent simultaneous logins
Create separate queues for different action types
Add rate limiting based on IP usage

##### 5. IP Rotation Strategy
GitHub Issue #5: Design Dynamic IP Rotation Strategy

Create algorithms for intelligent IP rotation
Implement cooldown periods between IP reuse
Add randomized usage patterns to mimic human behavior
Develop IP risk scoring based on usage history

##### 6. Ban Detection and Recovery
GitHub Issue #6: Implement Ban Detection and Recovery System

Create methods to detect when an IP is flagged or banned
Implement automatic IP quarantine for suspicious activity
Develop user notification system for account issues
Create recovery workflows for compromised accounts

####### 7. User Limits and Configuration
GitHub Issue #7: Add User-level IP Configuration

Modify subscription plans to include IP allocation limits
Add premium option for dedicated IPs
Create interface for users to monitor their IP status
Implement user-level configuration for activity patterns

######## 8. Admin Monitoring Dashboard
GitHub Issue #8: Develop IP Management Dashboard

Create administrative tools to monitor IP pool health
Add visualization for IP usage and distribution
Implement alerts for IP depletion or unusual activity
Create interface for manual IP management

######### 9. Geographical Distribution
GitHub Issue #9: Implement Geographical IP Distribution

Add server location awareness for IP assignment
Create logic to match IPs with user's typical connection location
Implement country/region-specific IP pools
Develop geo-fencing for suspicious login attempts

########## 10. Documentation and Compliance
GitHub Issue #10: Create Compliance Documentation

Update terms of service to reflect IP usage policies
Create user guidelines for safe account management
Develop internal documentation for IP system
Implement compliance tracking and reporting

File Structure for Implementation
New Files:

database/models/ip_pool.py - Model for IP management
database/models/proxy_service.py - Interface to proxy providers
startup/ip_manager.py - IP allocation and rotation logic
startup/session_isolation.py - Session management utilities
tasks/ip_rotation.py - IP rotation scheduling
web/templates/admin/ip_management.html - Admin IP management interface
web/templates/user/ip_status.html - User IP status view
utils/ban_detection.py - Ban detection algorithms
utils/geo_ip.py - Geographical IP utilities
config/ip_config.py - Configuration for IP management

Modified Files:

database/models/subscription.py - Add IP allocation limits
startup/browser_profile.py - Modify to use assigned IPs
tasks/auto_farm.py - Update to respect IP assignment
tasks/trainer/base.py - Update to respect IP assignment
web/routes/admin.py - Add IP management routes
web/routes/user.py - Add IP status routes
web/routes/api.py - Add IP-related API endpoints
web/app.py - Register new routes and middleware
main.py - Initialize IP management system
cron_jobs.py - Add IP rotation and health check jobs

By implementing this system, Travian Whispers can provide its automation services while respecting Travian's rules against multi-accounting from the same IP. This approach distributes user activity across different IPs and ensures that each user's actions appear to come from a unique location, minimizing the risk of detection or bans.
